This project involves the design, development and evaluation of a compliant neck exoskeleton for patients with Dropped head Syndrome(DHS). This affection weekens the neck extensot muscles resulting in cervical kyphosis. This deformity severely deteriorates gait, breathing and swallowing and current orthosis does not succesfully address this issues.
These reasons motivated me to explore alternative alternative solutions for a Daily Support device.

Our first achievement, came on the design of an actuation unit to support the head. Inspires by beam exoskeletons and continum robots, we design a multidirection leaf-spring mechanism of adjustable stiffness. The core of the system ia group of carbon fiber whose bending stiffness is adjusted by preloading the springs at the bottom shown in the figure.

This work which includes the teoretical model and experimental validation of the actuator and preeliminary user evaluation was presented at the Robosoft Conference 6th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft). 

The following steps involved increasing the stiffness range of the actuator to probide significant head support. Simultaneousky, we redesign the transmition sistem to decouple the head from the device during neck rotation, a motion that does not requires assitance and is highly prevalent in activities of daily life. 
The system was evaluated in persons with no preconditions proving it provides adjustable support on the sagittal plane without constrining rotations

At the current stage, we are starting clinical evaluation with end users to evaluate its effect on mobility. Our hypothesis is that the neck brace can enheance the neck posture and increase the range of motion of the neck.
