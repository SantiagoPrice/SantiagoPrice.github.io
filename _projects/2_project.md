This work involved and development of a tendon driven mechanism for a robotic finger actuated by nitinol wires. Nitinol is a Niquel-Titanium alloy with the particular property of recovering the shape when being heat up. In that sense, this elements can actuates as muscles when contracting by heat after being prestrech as the video shows
